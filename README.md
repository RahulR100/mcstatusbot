# Minecraft Server Status - Discord Bot

A simple [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) bot that displays the status of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com) servers.

## Summer 2025 Update Part 1 Release

Due to the sheer size of this update I have split it into 3 parts. Parts 2 and 3 will follow in the coming weeks.
Part 1 is a more technical update, and lays the groundwork for future feature updates.

- We have a brand new server! Now with 5x the cores and 2x the RAM
- Version 2 of the proxy is now in use. This should make all commands to the bot much faster
- A new custom ping server is also implemented, moving away from older libraries. This allows
- New DNS services are now implemented which should fix the server online -> offline -> online flicker bug
- The bot now runs using the new Docker version. This means all internal build pipelines are working well and this Docker version will be ready for yall to use soon

As usual, please open an issue here if you notice any bugs/abnormal behaviour. Thank you!

### Usage notes:

**Bedrock servers:** to use the `/status` and `/monitor` commands, you must set the `type` option to "Bedrock" for the bot to function correctly.

**Hosting/Proxy users:** Underscores are not allowed in Domain names! Please change your server address to remove underscores.

**Local IP Addresses** The bot will now filter out private IP addresses (192.168, 127.0.0, 10.0 etc) which are inaccessible to the bot. The bot will now show `Status: Error` if your server's IP address has been filtered. We recommend you use a free proxy such as [Minekube](https://connect.minekube.com/) or [Playit](https://playit.gg/) to make your server securely accessible via a domain, and then monitor that domain.

## Features

- Auto-updating voice channels to display the server's status and the number of players online
- Support for both Java and Bedrock servers
- Support for monitoring multiple Minecraft servers at once
- Check the status of non-monitored servers
- Slash command support with ephemeral responses (configurable) to prevent channels from being cluttered with commands
- Multiple languages: ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
