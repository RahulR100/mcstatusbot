# Minecraft Server Status - Discord Bot

A simple [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) bot that displays the status of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com) servers.

**To use:** Simply [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788083161296273517&permissions=269485072&scope=bot%20applications.commands) the
bot to your server.

## Fall 2025: Self hosted verion release!

The self-hosted version of the bot is now available for use! Read the [self host guide](https://github.com/RahulR100/mcstatusbot/blob/main/HOSTING.md) for installation and usage.

Other updates:
- Package and server software updates
- General bugfixes

As usual, please open an issue here if you notice any bugs/abnormal behaviour. Thank you!

### Usage notes:

**Bedrock servers:** to use the `/status` and `/monitor` commands, you must set the `type` option to "Bedrock" for the bot to function correctly.

**Hosting/Proxy users:** Underscores are not allowed in Domain names! Please change your server address to remove underscores.

**Local IP Addresses** The bot will now filter out private IP addresses (192.168, 127.0.0, 10.0 etc) which are inaccessible to the bot. The bot will now show `Status: Error` if your server's IP address has been filtered. We recommend you use a free proxy such as [Minekube](https://connect.minekube.com/) or [Playit](https://playit.gg/) to make your server securely accessible via a domain, and then monitor that domain.

## Features

- Auto-updating voice channels to display the server's status and the number of players online
- Support for both Java and Bedrock servers
- Support for monitoring multiple Minecraft servers at once
- Check the status of non-monitored servers
- Slash command support with ephemeral responses (configurable) to prevent channels from being cluttered with commands
- Multiple languages: ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
